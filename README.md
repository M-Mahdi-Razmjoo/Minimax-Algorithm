# Minimax Algorithm Project
This project implements the Minimax algorithm, a fundamental strategy in game theory used to make optimal decisions in two-player, zero-sum games. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with code to illustrate the algorithm's functionality, structure, and results.

## Overview
The Minimax algorithm is a recursive approach that simulates all possible moves in a game to help a player make the best possible decision, taking into account the opponent’s optimal strategy. The algorithm's purpose is to maximize the player's minimum gain (or minimize their maximum loss), which is especially useful in adversarial games where each player's gain is the other’s loss. The algorithm is particularly effective in games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, and Checkers, where each player aims to outwit the opponent.

## Key Concepts
**1-Game Tree:** The Minimax algorithm builds a tree structure of all possible moves from the current game state. Each node represents a game state resulting from a move, and edges represent the transition from one state to another.

**2-Maximizing Player vs. Minimizing Player:** Maximizing Player: The player for whom the algorithm is trying to maximize the score. This player selects the move with the highest possible outcome. Minimizing Player: The opponent, whose strategy is to minimize the outcome of the maximizing player. This player picks the move that yields the lowest score for the maximizing player.

**3-Scoring** Each terminal state (a state where the game ends, such as a win, loss, or draw) is assigned a score:
-Positive score (e.g., +1) if the maximizing player wins
-Negative score (e.g., -1) if the minimizing player wins
-Zero (0) for a draw

**4-Recursive Exploration:** The algorithm recursively explores each possible move and its resulting game states. By backtracking, it propagates the scores up the tree, allowing the initial game state to be evaluated based on potential future moves.

## Algorithm Steps
**Generate Possible Moves:** Identify all possible moves from the current state.
**Simulate Moves:** For each move, update the game state and alternate between maximizing and minimizing players.
**Recursive Evaluation:** If the game has not reached a terminal state, call Minimax recursively on the new game state.
**Backtrack Scores:** Once a terminal state is reached, backtrack the scores to the original game state. The maximizing player chooses the highest score, while the minimizing player selects the lowest score.
**Optimal Decision:** At the root node, the maximizing player selects the move associated with the highest backtracked score, which is the optimal move.

## Implementation
The implementation in the notebook includes:

**Game Setup:** Initialize a basic two-player game environment with possible moves and rules.
**Minimax Function:** A recursive function that evaluates and returns the optimal move.
**Visualization (optional):** If applicable, a visualization of the game tree, illustrating how each node (move) is evaluated.



## Applications
### Game AI
The Minimax algorithm is commonly used to develop AI agents for two-player games:

**Chess and Checkers:** These games benefit from the depth of analysis the Minimax algorithm provides, simulating moves many turns ahead.
**Tic-Tac-Toe:** Minimax can easily solve this game, demonstrating the concept and optimal strategy.
**Connect Four:** Similarly, Minimax can be extended to this game with a suitable depth limit.
### Educational Tool
This project is an excellent resource for students and researchers learning about game theory, AI, and decision-making algorithms.



## Limitations and Extensions
### Computational Complexity
The Minimax algorithm has an exponential time complexity of O(b^d), where b is the branching factor (number of possible moves) and d is the depth of the game tree. This can make Minimax impractical for games with large branching factors and deep game trees (e.g., Chess).

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
To improve efficiency, you can implement Alpha-Beta Pruning, an enhancement to Minimax that "prunes" unnecessary branches in the game tree, reducing the number of states evaluated and speeding up the algorithm.
